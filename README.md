# Intermittent 401 Unauthorized Error in Next.js API Route with NextAuth

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Next.js API route protected by NextAuth intermittently returns a 401 Unauthorized error, even when a user is logged in.  The issue seems related to timing or race conditions in the session verification process.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that requests to the API route `/api/protected` sometimes return a 401 error, even with a valid session.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the issue by explicitly handling the possible null value returned by `unstable_getServerSession` and providing more robust error handling.
